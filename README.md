ICO
The ICO has two stages the primary market actual ICO and secondary market after the ICO, for the ICO the investor will pay you in crypto(DAI Token) and in exchange you will send them a token they bought. The crypto that is used for paying can be ether or an ERC20 token that you are willing to accept.
The ICO is limited in time and once this is over this is secondary market, so in the secondary market investor want to trade your token Buy/Sell for that they will need to use decentralize exchange like UniSwap.
So in this Project I have created two Ethereum Smart Contract. One for ICO that is Primary Market where we accept DAI token and another is for creating token using ERC20 Standard.
